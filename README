A Mavenised Selenium Test Framework.

This project has been written using IntelliJ IDEA.  If you open the parent POM file with IDEA it will automatically create the IDEA project files for you.

The community edition of IDEA is available to download here and is free:

I don't use Eclipse so I can't provide .project and .classpath files, however eclipse should be able to work with POM files as well.  Please see the following links:
