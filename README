A Mavenised Selenium Test Framework (Built using Maven 2.2.1)

This project has been written using IntelliJ IDEA.  If you open the parent POM file with IDEA it will automatically create the IDEA project files for you.

The community edition of IDEA is available to download here and is free:

I don't use Eclipse so I can't provide .project and .classpath files, however eclipse should be able to work with POM files as well.  Please see the following links:

If you have dependency problems you probably need to do an initial build of the project, this can be done via the command line/terminal:

 * Open a terminal/command prompt
 * Navigate to the project root dir
 * type “mvn clean install –U”

This will do an initial build, update all your dependencies using maven and put the locally built ebselen jars into your .m2 directory.

To do the above you will need to have maven installed and accessible through the command line:

All selenium tests should be placed within the ebselen-test module under the tests folder.  They also must end with ET, and must not have "Test" in thier name (e.g. GoogleExampleET.java).  This ensures that building the framework does not run the selenium tests, and running the selenium test does not invoke all the framework tests.

To run selenium tests type "mvn clean install -Pebselen-tests"
